/**
 * Scoring for the moderation review queue.
 *
 * Deliberately pure and DB-free so the judgement calls are unit-testable, and
 * deliberately advisory: nothing here ever hides anyone. It only decides what a
 * human looks at first, and every signal is surfaced with a human-readable
 * reason so the reviewer can disagree with it.
 *
 * The signals are chosen to separate two very different situations that look
 * identical in the totals:
 *   - someone submitting fabricated usage, and
 *   - our own inflation bug (#960: daily active_time_ms is not
 *     timezone-invariant, so re-scanning under another TZ re-splits intervals
 *     and the monotonic per-device merge ratchets the total upward).
 * `dailyMismatch` is the signal that distinguishes them, which is why a high
 * score is a prompt to investigate rather than a verdict.
